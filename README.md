# BlackjackNetworkGame

## Introduction

This project is a networked Blackjack (21) game where multiple players can play simultaneously against a dealer (server).  
Players can join or leave at any time, place bets, and play their turns independently.  
The server manages the game state, ensures consistency, and handles the dealer logic.
